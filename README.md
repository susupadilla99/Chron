# Welcome to my deliverables

## Nominated Device:

Iphone 11 Pro

Most iOS device would work as well. It just looks best (and is developed with) that iPhone model.

## How to use:

You'll start at the Welcome Screen. Here you can choose to:

1. Register for an account
2. Login

If you entered your details for registration, you can use the email and password credentials to login

If you choose to login, you can use one of the two pre-made credentials to login:

Credential 1: (just for fun)
```
Email: oscarslapper@gmail.com
password: password
```

Credential 2: (great tutor)
```
Email: hubert.hartan@mq.edu.au
password: 1234
```

## Screens & features

**Home Screen**: Does... virtually nothing. It's there to "welcome" users into the app and options to switch to Profile or Memories Screen. (I wanted to add more features but I ran out of time)

**Profile Screen**: Currently provides the option to logout. In the future, I do want to make other screens funcitonal.

**Memory Screen**: A place to view all memories, add more memories or view details about a memory.

**Memory Info Screen**: View details about a memory. Also have the option to edit the memory.
